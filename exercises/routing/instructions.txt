---------------------------------
1. Create .js script in public. This file will run in the browser.

2. Create .hbs or .ejs file that references 
   the .js created in #1 inside a <script> element.
   
3. Create .js script that will server as your router 
   for this exercise.
---------------------------------

Your router should have 2 routes:

A. GET route that renders your view, 
   passing in the title and other info you need.
   
B. POST route that passes JSON data up and 
   receives JSON data back down after a simple modification 
   you make inside the route.
